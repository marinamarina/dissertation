\prefacesection{Abstract}
The aim of the project is to build a web application simulating the football betting experience and addressing two main issues. Firstly, filling an existing void for a system that makes football match prediction customizable and transparent to the user. For each upcoming match, the application will provide the user with an overall probability of either of the two teams winning the match based on the current football statistics and expressed in percentage. The user would then be able to influence this probability value by adjusting the weights for each of the several factors that contributed to that result. Depending on the values of the weights, prediction may be different for different users. In the long run, users of the web application would be able to create their own "betting system" by constantly re-adjusting the default prediction weights and hopefully coming up with a set of weights that works the best. Secondly, allowing the users to analyse their past performance and compare their results and prediction weights with the other users of the application.

The stated above would be achieved by taking several steps. First, the background research will be carried out. On completion of the research, 
current similar websites will be researched and a set of requirements will be created to assess usersâ€™ needs. After that a layout and overall design of the application will be produced, as well as the desired behavior of its features. Once the prototyping is completed, the main project deliverable, i.e. working web application will be developed and throughly tested.
