\section{Background}
\label{sec:background_intro}
Gambling is surely one of the oldest forms of entertainment known to man. Wherever you may find a situation or event where the outcome is in doubt, you will find someone willing to bet on it. References to gambling go back to the beginning of recorded history and in nearly all cultures throughout the world.  It is also frowned upon in many different religions and cultures but rarely banned outright, it has been around for a very long time and does not look like it will be disappearing any time soon.  One of the oldest forms of gambling is betting on sporting events. The Romans bet on the outcome of chariot races and gladiator fights, the Greeks on the olympics, all the way through to today where you can not only bet on the outcome of every sporting event anywhere in the world but also, thanks in large part to the rise of internet gambling and live updates of events as they happen, you can bet on any aspect of the event - e.g. in the case of football matches you can bet on number of goals scored, who scored them and even the number of corners in a match - the possibilities are almost endless.

Online gambling really began to take off in 1994 when Antigua and Barbuda passed the Free Trade and Processing Act that entitled this Caribbean nation to grant licenses to those willing to open online casinos. The next industry development milestone was the formation of the Kahnawake Gaming Commission in 1996 in Canada. The commission issued gaming licenses to many online casinos and poker rooms \citep{art:historyofonlinegambling}.

Another important event contributing to the beginnings of the new industry was the creation of a software development company, Microgaming Software Systems, that built the first piece of functional software to be used in the online gaming sites. The company claims they released the first online casino in 1994. It is hard to verify that fact, but they were definitely one of the first. The technology behind their casino was a success and the company concentrated on developing various casino games and supplying them to other online casinos \citep{source:microgaming} \citep{source:gamblingsites}. Since the mid 1990's the industry began to flourish. For example, there were only 15 online casinos in 1996. This number reached 200 sites by the end of 1997 \citep{art:historyofonlinegambling}.  

Online sports betting industry took off shortly after the early online casinos and grew exceptionally quickly. Placing bets on sporting events online soon became very popular with gamblers all over the world. The existing bookmakers opened websites and many new companies joined the newly formed market \citep{source:gamblingsites}. Amongst the types of online sports gambling, betting on football is the most popular, leading the industry with a share about 70\% with roughly half a million people betting weekly all over the world \citep{footballbettinggamblingindustry}. The popularity of betting on football, especially the so-called "in-play" betting (a type of betting when punters place bets as the event happens), was fueled by the increased coverage of the football matches by popular satellite television channels. According to \citet{footballbettinggamblingindustry}, the popularity of football gambling skyrocketed before the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.

When it comes to any sports betting, football betting included, the player is trying to predict the result of the event and placing money on the outcome. This prediction can be made based on a “hunch” or by using logic and domain knowledge, in a lot of cases by both combined. This gave rise to a variety of betting software systems that attempt to predict the next match result. Most of the time these betting systems work as a “black box” not allowing the user to influence the prediction output and preventing the user from understanding the exact logic used inside the system.

People gambling on football can have various strategies when making a betting decision. As mentioned above, the user can buy prediction software and simply follow the tips suggested by that system. Another option is to make a decision influenced by the opinion of the other tipsters, experts’ opinions or rumours. However, most experienced gamblers would likely ignore the tips and predictions of others and analyse the pure statistics themselves before trying to make their own prediction. According to \citet{britannica2015gamblingandsports}, a contributor to the Encyclopedia Britannica, "One of the most popular forms of gambling is wagering on sports, which taps into the passion of sports fans. A bet placed on a race or a game allows fans to prove their knowledge of a sport or to show their loyalty to a particular team or competitor”. In other words, it’s not only about the money but also as a way to prove that your own judgement is superior to others. To make this happen, the gambler has to aggregate numerous pieces of information from various sources. This action has to be repeated for every single match.

From my experience, the necessity to repeat an action many times could lead to a creation of interesting software solutions. That is how I got inspired to create an application that would aggregate this information for the user and therefore act as an interactive decision supporting system.

\section{Proposed Web Application}
\label{sec:proposedwebapp_intro}
A web application aiming to forecast football match results is nothing new. However, most of the existing solutions either overwhelm their users with unstructured statistics or work as a self-contained black-box prediction tool preventing the users from participating in the process of prediction. The proposed system will provide its users with all the necessary information to support their betting decision and allow them to take full control over the prediction output. To the best of my knowledge no other software offers the same experience as the one proposed in this dissertation.

\section{Target Audience}
\label{sec:targetaudience_intro}
The intended users of the application will be people with an interest in football, more specifically in betting on football. With this in mind, the age range of potential users will be 18 and up.

\section{Problems Addressed}
\label{sec:problemsaddressed_intro}

\subsection*{Problem 1 - Before placing a bet, football punters have to aggregate different pieces of football statistics from various sources.}
Most football punters will spend a lot of time gathering and analysing information about a football match. This can be anything from watching the previous games on television, reading expert analysis in newspapers to looking at specialised websites that show every possible statistic about a team or player. The application proposed in this dissertation will do this job for the user. It will aggregate all the data that may affect the outcome of an upcoming match and also make a comparison of the participating teams.

Among other benefits, the easy access to relevant data will hopefully encourage the application users to make betting decisions based on facts rather that an impulse or other punters’ advice.

\subsection*{Problem 2 - Punters would like to be able to make their own prediction formula.}
When betting on football, there is always a temptation to base a betting decision on a opinion of someone else or use prediction software and there are those who make a living off selling tips to punters. However, as mentioned previously, a serious sports gambler wants to be able to use their own knowledge and judgement to win, rather than rely on a third party “tipster”.

The choice of factors that can influence a football match result can differ greatly for each punter. One may think that a team’s form is the most important factor going into a match, while the next may think that the team’s league position is the best judge of how they are going to do. The users of the proposed application will be able to create their own betting system by picking from the various factors and assigning them a weighting percentage, having the power to influence the prediction output.

\subsection*{Problem 3 - Football punters rarely monitor their betting results.}
Learning from the past mistakes is a key to becoming successful in any activity. The application will offer a way to monitor the performance of user's betting system in order to be able to improve it over time.

\section{Project Aims \& Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives_intro}
The overall aim of this project is to build a betting simulator that provides an effective solution to the above problems and enables its users to create their own, hopefully successful, betting system in the long run.
