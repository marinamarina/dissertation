\section{Background}
\label{sec:background_intro}
People have always been interested in games with the element of luck and therefore gambling is one of the oldest forms of entertainment of mankind. The rise of the Internet and mobile devices has made remote gambling more available for a wide variety of users. The reason for that could be that Internet applications and websites can be are easily accessed 24/7. Amongst the most popular types of online gambling can be named card games, such as poker, online casinos and betting on sporting events.

It is believed that online gambling began in 1994 when Antigua and Barbuda passed the Free Trade and Processing Act that entitled this Carribean nation to grant lisenses to those willing to open online casinos. The next industry development milestone was the formation of the Kahnawake Gaming Commission in 1996. The comission issued gaming lisenses to many online casinos and pocker rooms \citep{art:historyofonlinegambling}. 

Another important event contributing to the beginnings of the new industry was a creation of a software development company Microgaming Software Systems that created first piece of functional software to be used in the online gaming sites. The company claims they have released the first online casino in 1994. It is hard to verify the fact, but they were definitely among one of the first. The technology behind their casino was a success and the company concentrated on developing casino games and supplying them to other online casinoes \citep{source:microgaming} \citep{source:gamblingsites}. Since the mid of 1990's the industry began to flourish. For example, there were only 15 online casinoes in 1996. This number reached 200 sites by the end of 1997 \citep{art:historyofonlinegambling}.   

"One of the most popular forms of gambling is wagering on sports, which taps into the passion of sports fans. A bet placed on a race or a game allows fans to prove their knowledge of a sport or to show their loyalty to a particular team or competitor."\citep{britannica2015gamblingandsports} Online sports betting industry took off shortly after the early online casinos and grew exceptionally quickly. Placing bets on sporting events online soon became very popular with gamblers all over the world. The existing bookmakers opened websites and many new companies joined the newly formed market \citep{source:gamblingsites}. Among all types of online sports gambling, football gambling is one of the most popular leading industry with a share about 70\% and half a million people betting weekly all over the world \citep{footballbettinggamblingindustry}. The popularity of betting on football, especially the so-called "in-running" betting (a type of betting when punters place bets as the event happens), was fueled by the increased coverage of the football matches by the popular satelite television channels. According to \citet{footballbettinggamblingindustry}, the popularity of football gambling sky rocketed before the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.

When it comes to any sports betting, football betting including, the player is trying to predict the result of the event and placing the money on the outcome. This prediction can be made based on a “hunch” or by using logic and domain knowledge, in a lot of cases by both combined. Naturally, this gave rise to a variety of betting software systems that are attempting to predict the next match result. Most of the time those betting systems work as a “black box” not allowing the user to influence the prediction output and preventing the user from understanding the exact logic used inside the system.
Football bettor can have various strategies when making a betting decision. As mentioned above, the user can buy a prediction software and simply follow the tips suggested by that system. Another option is to make a decision influenced by the opinion of the other tipsters, experts’ opinions or rumours. However, if the aim is to achieve sustainable profit (or minimise the loss from betting) , most experienced bettors would ignore betting tips and predictions of others and go for the pure facts trying to make their own prediction. To make this happen, the bettor has to aggregate several pieces of information from various sources. This action has to be repeated for every single match.

From my experience, the necessity to repeat an action many times could lead to a creation of interesting software solutions. That is how I got inspired to create an application that would aggregate this information for the user and therefore act as an interactive decision supporting system.

\section{Proposed Web Application}
\label{sec:proposedwebapp_intro}
A web application aiming to forecast football match results is nothing new. However, most of the existing solutions either overwhelm their users with unstructured statistics or work as a self-contained black-box prediction tool preventing the users from participating in the process of prediction. The proposed system will provide its users with all necessary information to support their betting decision and allow them to take full control over the prediction output. To the best of my knowledge no other software offers the same experience as the one proposed in this dissertation.

\section{Target Audience}
\label{sec:targetaudience_intro}
The intended users of the application will be people with interest in football, more specifically in betting on football. With this in mind, the age range of potential users will be 18 and up.

\section{Problems Addressed}
\label{sec:problemsaddressed_intro}

\subsection*{Problem 1 - Football punters have to aggregate pieces of football statistics needed to place a bet from various sources.}
has to aggregate several pieces of information from various sources

When betting on football, there is always a temptation to base a betting decision on a opinion of someone else or use prediction software. However, experts can be wrong or not even following their own forecasts. It can also be quite confusing, which particular expert’s prediction to follow, and after all, opinions of different experts often contradict. 

On the opposite side, a serious football punter will spend a lot of time gathering and analysing statistics about a football match (possibly, just using a notepad and a pen). The application proposed in this dissertation will do this job for the user. It will aggregate all the data that may affect the outcome of an upcoming match and also make a comparison of the participating teams.

Among other benefits, the easy access to relevant data will hopefully encourage the application users to make betting decisions based on facts rather that an impulse or other punters’ advice.

\subsection*{Problem 2 - Punters would like to be able to make their own prediction formula.}
The choice of factors that can influence a football match result will differ depending on a punter's betting system. The users of the proposed application will be able to create their own betting system by picking from the different ??? factors and assigning them a weighing percentage, having the power to influence the prediction output.

\subsection*{Problem 3 - Football punters rarely monitor their betting results.}
Learning from the past mistakes is a key to becoming successful in any activity. The application will offer a way to monitor the performance of user's betting system in order to be able to improve it over time. 

\section{Project Aims \& Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives_intro}
The overall aim of this project is to build a betting simulator that provides an effective solution to the above problems and enables its users to create their own, hopefully successful, betting system in the long run. 

\section{Report Structure}
