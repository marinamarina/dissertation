The questionnaire should only take around five minutes to fill in and your answers will be used to aid the development of a web application simulating the football betting experience. The future application will provide its users with all the necessary football statistics (without going too much into detail) and allow them to participate in the prediction process by making their own prediction formula.

\chapter{Wireframes}
\label{ch:wireframes}
When the app is launched it silently registers with the server
allowing the user to use the app immediately. The user is then shown
the middle-top screen.
\begin{enumerate}
\item From the middle top screen, the user can follow arrow 1 by
  clicking on the middle button "Pick Mission'' to pick a Mission
  (Run around Arran or Egg for example) and then pick a start and
  end location. After confirming these choices, the user is taken
  back to the middle top screen, or at any time can click the
  "Home'' button to return. 
\item The user can also view their current acheivements by clicking
  the "Achievements" button on the middle top screen, following
  arrow 2. These achievements will be grouped by tabs by category -
  Distance, Time, Stage and Mission based achievements.
\item The user can follow arrow 3 from the middle top screen to
  notify the app that they are starting an exercise period, telling
  the app to track their distance. If a Mission and start and end
  location are not picked (as in point 1) then they will instead be
  redirected to this screen and are unable to start exercising until
  this choice has been made. Once they have successfully advanced to
  this screen, it will display their current progress as they move
  showing the user how close to completion of their current stage
  and overall route they are. 
\item When the user has finished exercising, they will click the
  "End Session'' button and be taken to the first summary screen -
  following arrow 4. Here statistics from their exercise will be
  shown and the option to share this on several social media
  outlets.
\item The user can then move to the second and final summary screen,
  following arrow 5, where they will be shown any achievements they
  were awarded during that session. The user will also have the
  option to share these on social media outlets. From here, the user
  can click the "Home" button and be taken back to the middle top
  screen. 
\end{enumerate}
