\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:Conclusion}
This chapter summarises the main outcomes and conclusions resulting from this body of work.

\section{Assessment of Success}
There are meny aspects of this project that should be inspected in order to decide if the project was successful or not.

Using Agile development approach allowed me to concentrate on the result without wasting my time creating final diagrams and overviews before starting with the implementation. It helped me to cut down the preparation phase to the bare essentials, reduced project overhead and made the whole development process more efficient.

Overall, I feel the project has been very successful with a well-designed web application as a result.

\section{Improvements and Future Work}
a prototype suggesting what the system is capable of, rather than a fully-functional and well-tested module

Further development that could be carried out in the future.
In the future I expect to put more leagues, so more English and European leagues are supported
More modules (Injuries and suspensions, manager), allowing user to choose from a large variety of inputs and even
remove a module from the view

more detailed information in the played match, a view containing feedback

 I believe my project does hold commercial promise
 
 I hope that, through the module, I can at least develop a plausible promise as to what the system is capable of. The maritime module is a prototype, a placeholderâ€¦ 
 
 If I were to continue with the project beyond university, my plan would be to develop even more
