This chapter summarises the main outcomes and conclusions resulting from this body of work.

\section{Assessment of Success}

There are meny aspects of this project that should be inspected in order to decide if the project was successful or not.

Using Agile development approach allowed me to concentrate on the result without wasting my time creating final diagrams and overviews before starting with the implementation. It helped me to cut down the preparation phase to the bare essentials, reduced project overhead and made the whole development process more efficient.

Overall, I feel the project has been very successful with a well-designed web application as a result.

\section{Improvements and Future Work}

Further development that could be carried out in the future.
In the future I expect to put more leagues, so any league is supported
More modules (Injuries and suspensions, manager)
remove a module from the view
more detiled information in the played match, a view containing feedback
